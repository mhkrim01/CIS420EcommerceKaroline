            The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total
            eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny
            silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers
            from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed
            by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly
            laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing
            the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.

            A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.
            The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone
            figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations
            who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy
            hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable
            lad with a prize-winning smile.

          Karoline has made my special event cakes for the past 3 years! 
          I can't rave about how wonderful she is at creating any product if you just 
          give her a picture or idea. She has never disappointed.
